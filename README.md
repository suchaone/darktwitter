# install instructions (for stylebot)

1. install [stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en), a chrome extension for customizing css on pages
2. go to twitter.com
3. click on the sylebot icon
4. click on the edit CSS button
5. paste the contents of [this file](https://suchaone.github.io/darktwitter/style.css) into the text area
6. click save

If you would like to use a higher resolution animation of bob dobbs for your like button, follow these steps:

1. download [this png file](http://i.imgur.com/sHxPkcA.png)
2. send it to yourself in a DM
3. copy the URL of the image within the DM
4. in style.css, replace the URL of the .HeartAnimation background-image with the one from your DM

the reason for this hackery is that twitter will only serve images from its own domains, and files attached to public tweets are resized
